CMake Warning (dev) at /home/clarence/Softwares/CLion-2020.3.2/clion-2020.3.2/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args`
  (PCL_POINT_CLOUD_EDITOR) does not match the name of the calling package
  (PCL).  This can lead to problems in calling code that expects
  `find_package` result variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain
  pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:619 (find_package_handle_standard_args)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
